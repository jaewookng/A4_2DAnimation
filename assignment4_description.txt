intended animation:
A cuckoo clock with moving minute and hour hands, whose movements are proportional (minute:hour) but not synced to real time; two pendulums swinging at the bottom of the clock with a fox and bird, their swing periods slightly offset, adn the fox and bird tilt up and down continuously while they swing; a revolving sun and moon animation.

drew assets for the clock face/base, pendulum sticks, pendulum animals.
created Pendulum() class with constructor that allowed specification of pendulum position, pendulum stick size, pendulum animal size, swing speed, max swing angle, offset of swing phase so they're not both moving visually in sync.
Pendulum() class has an Update method to update the pendulum swing angle each frame (I used sine from friday to calculate the angle so I didn't have to manually make it oscillate at specific points and make the animation smoother), and to animate the pendulum animals so they rock up and down while swinging attached to the pendulum sticks.
Pendulum() class has Display method that takes the matrix for the clock face as the pivot point everything is attached to (the parent). draws the sticks of the pendulums and draws the attached animals inheriting the swinging of the pendulums.

The assets for the sun, moon, and stars, along with the cloud assets, were created to function as celestial elements which will appear in the mechanical clock background.
The system's position and scale factor and atmosphere color tint and orbit speed parameters, which the constructor of the CelestialBackground() class allows users to specify, enable users to distinguish between day and night cycles. The Update method of the CelestialBackground() class updates the timer by using the elapsed time together with orbit speed to determine the non-linear movement of celestial bodies. 
I used a sine and cosine function to handle the orbital calculations so I didn't have to manually update positions, which allowed the sun and moon, along with the stars and clouds, to move in a smooth, continuous circular path. 
The Draw method of the CelestialBackground() class enables screen position input to create a root Matrix, which uses scale and translation to define the parent coordinate system that structures the entire system. 
The system draws two celestial assets by using the parent matrix as a reference point, while the second asset maintains a distance of pi from the first asset to ensure they stay on opposite sides of the orbit path, which enables the children to receive the transformation and positioning of the complete system. 
The star and cloud set is tinted purple and moves non linear in a smaller radius than the sun and moon, as well rotates at a different rate.

Created ClockHands() class with a Dtheta (change in angle over unit time) and dt for time elapsed. I set this to (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds to translate each degree movement of the minute hand to one second. The private method MakeTick() is a class updater that applies the conjugated Matrices in translation rotation order. The rotation matrix is a simple rotation about the Z-axis, correspondent to the actual displayed Angle field (which is continuously updated by MakeTick). This process ensures that the hands rotate correctly around the clock's center while inheriting the proper positioning from the parent pivot.
